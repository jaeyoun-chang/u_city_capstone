# Capstone Project: Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services

### About the project

This repository is for the final project for the Data Science Nanodegree program at Udacity. The project focuses on utilizing various machine learning techniques to analyze demographic data from both the general population and customers of a sales company.
The project has two primary objectives:

* To understand the characteristics of the companyâ€™s customers in comparison to the general population, we will employ machine learning algorithms and datasets provided by Arvato, a mail-order company in Germany.
* The project also involves developing a model that can predict how customers will respond to marketing campaigns.

Through this project, our aim is to gain valuable insights into the customer base of the company and leverage those insights to create an effective marketing strategy.

In addition to general modules like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn,  
you need to install matplotlib.ticker, Image from IPython.display, missingno,  
Translator from googletrans, Levenshtein, pyarrow, pyarrow.parquet, pickle and tqdm by
